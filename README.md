# Delicious-Recipe-Collection
Number of Pages Required: Single Page (One HTML page)
In this project, you will build a responsive recipe card page where each card represents a recipe with a
description, ingredients, and a preparation method.The page should be designed to adjust gracefully
to various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.The goal is to create a visually appealing and
functional layout that showcases recipes in an organized and easy-to-read format.This project will help
you practice responsive design, flexbox, grid systems, and CSS media queries.
Small Step-by-Step Guide:
HTML Structure:
Set up the basic structure using HTML. Each recipe card should have:
A title (e.g., recipe name).
A brief description of the recipe.
A list of ingredients.
Preparation instructions.
An image representing the recipe (optional but recommended for a more visually appealing
design).
CSS Styling:
Use CSS Flexbox or CSS Grid to create a responsive layout for the recipe cards.
Each card should be styled with padding, borders, and shadows to make it visually appealing.
Ensure the layout adjusts based on the screen size by using media queries. For example, on
smaller screens (e.g., mobile), the cards could stack vertically instead of being arranged in rows.
Apply custom fonts, colors, and background images to make the design modern and attractive.
Responsiveness:
Use CSS media queries to ensure the recipe cards are fully responsive:
On large screens (desktops and tablets), display the cards in a grid with multiple columns.
On small screens (mobile), stack the cards vertically.
Card Hover Effects:
Implement hover effects on the recipe cards, such as changing the background color or showing a
slight zoom on the recipe image.
Optional Features:
Filter by Cuisine: Implement a filter where users can choose a cuisine type (e.g., Italian, Mexican,
etc.) and only the relevant recipe cards will appear.
Recipe Rating: Add a section where users can rate the recipe (using stars or a numerical rating).
Ingredient List Toggle: Allow the user to toggle between viewing just the ingredients or the full
recipe (e.g., using a "Show More" button).
Testing:
Test the page on various screen sizes to ensure it displays correctly and responsively.You can use
browser tools to simulate different device views.
